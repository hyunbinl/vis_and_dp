*_script.py or *_scr.py are "main" for generating heatmaps

other python codes are used as libraries:

- aggregator.py: functions which deal with creating a aggregate power consumption matrix
- parser.py: functions which parse h5f or xls files
- printer.py: functions dealing with heatmap generation
- diffp.py: functions deal with computing sensitivity and adding noises
